# Note on answers

**For the question 2.1.h:**
Since we have proven the consistency of classical logic with `constructive_consistency`.
"To be equivalent" just means to show it.

**For question 2.2.a (about WModel):**
We notice that the rules for bot_M(w) are the same as mu_M(w,x) for a fixed value of x.
This comes from the fact that without the exfalso rule, the bot is just a variable.
We will threfore interpret bot as var 0 in the model, and all variable as var S x.
